Adds Jetpack's responsive video support to your website.

== Description ==

WARNING! You have to activate Jetpack by WordPress.com plugin first. This plugin is not working without Jetpack.

Jetpack includes an option to add responsive video support to your website and thus make sure that all videos display just as nicely on mobile devices as they do on your largest display.

One of the things that is often overlooked when developing a responsive theme is making videos responsive.

This plugin ensures that any videos are responsive, no additional markup or special coding required. It just works! Every video on your site will display just as nicely on mobile devices as they do on your largest display.
